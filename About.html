    <p class="about">Hey guys I'm Shreyashkumar Zingade. Now it has been five years being a professional photographer.
      Since photography has  been my family business too it has always been within me from my childhood days. I am currently pursuing chemical engineering and following photography as a passion with keen interest.
      It was my 10th standard vacations when I had started visiting our Photography Studio (Shree Digital Foto Studio, Solapur) frequently and that was the time when I completely came in contact with photography.
      My very first gurus in this newly discovered passion of mine are my mother and father (Jayshree Zingade and Anil Zingade who is well known as Anil Baba in film industry). Further this was carried ahead by some very talented and astonishing photographers and also my beloved brothers Anand Zingade, Solapur and Ranjan Zingade (Kodak Better Phototography Wedding Photographer of the year 2010), Pune who took my photography to the very next level.<br>
      It was when I was in my 11th and 12th standard I worked a lot of photography skills. Performing assignments of our family organization "Shree" which gave me a strong control over cameras and also made me confident in further continuing photography professionally and more deeply. <br>
      It was year 2015 when I joined the renowned institute "Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering".Here it was Prof. Shwetambari Waghmare madam, who first recognized my photography skills and being the pillar always supported me and  referred me for our college's event photography.
      On presenting my work, there were personalities who gave me further opportunities, Principal M.Z. Shaikh Sir, H.O.D. of Applied Science Dr. J.J. Kadam Sir and also Director of Bharati Vidyapeeth, Navi Mumbai Dr. Vilasrao Kadam Sir. <br>
      As time passed by my contacts kept on growing and I went on being recognized as a photographer widely. Now time  being really great and my skills developed tremendously I have been receiving calls from various branches of Bharati Vidyapeeth as a professional photographer.
      Along with Event Photography I have also been doing Wedding Photography, Fashion Photography, Candid Photography, Videography &amp; lot more.
      Apart from photography I am a master at Photoshop &amp; Premiere Pro Editing.</p>
